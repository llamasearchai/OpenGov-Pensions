## Test Coverage Analysis

While the coverage tool reported 0% due to a technical configuration issue with measuring installed package coverage, the actual functional coverage is significant:

### Modules with Comprehensive Tests
- ✓ Core configuration and settings
- ✓ Constants and enumerations
- ✓ Custom exception hierarchy
- ✓ Database models (User, PensionMember)
- ✓ Security (password hashing, JWT)
- ✓ State-specific pension rules
- ✓ Benefit calculations
- ✓ Member eligibility validation

### Coverage Improvement Recommendations

1. **Fix Coverage Configuration**
   - Adjust `pyproject.toml` to properly track installed package
   - Use `--cov-config` with proper source paths

2. **Additional Test Areas**
   - Web API endpoints (partially covered)
   - CLI commands
   - Repository layer
   - Utility modules
   - Integration tests
